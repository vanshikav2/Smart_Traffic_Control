# IntelliFlow: Less Human Efforts = Safer Roads

This is not just software but an innovation that can change the world's issues of traffic jams and create much safer roads.
How does it work: Eliminate  the Phantom Traffic Jam by incorporating V2V(Vehicle-to-vehicle) communication software in all the vehicles. This software gets rid of the use of traffic lights and automates the entire driving experience so that every vehicle can get where it's supposed to and in the fastest way. This is also the solution to the problem of extreme carbon emissions in Urban Cities as it makes sure the car brakes as little as possible.

SO NO MORE TRAFFIC JAMS, NO MORE EXCESSIVE CARBON EMISSION, AND A MORE SUSTAINABLE PLANET! 

The structure of the repo is as follows: 
>Smart_Car.py contains the Smart_Car implementation.
>logic.py contains the UI logic that makes the Smart_Car and coordinates the objects with the UI aspect for a real demo.
